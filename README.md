# The Lion King Maze
A multithreaded client-server maze game which includes Object Oriented Programming, design patterns, search algorithms, compress and decompress methods and unit testing. 

# Generate a new random maze and try to solve it

By running the project the game will appear.
The default maze is 10*10.
You can use the mouse to move or by the keyboard (as you wish).
